# Sigal Gallery

This is just a reminder how things work :-)

- config points to /storage/pictures
- every subfolder of that is a gallery (e.g. 2014 Central America)
- if a folder should not be made into a gallery, a .nomedia file is placed in it
- in the gallery folder a index.md can be placed to set the title for example
- sigal build generates the html and thumbnails
- sigal serve -p 8090 starts the dev server on port 8090
